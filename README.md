Usage:
```
./petya_key [victim_data]
```
where the `[victim_data]` is a file containing the 'personal decryption code' displayed by the bootlocker

1) Save your _"Personal decryption code"_ as a continuous string, without separators. Example of the valid file content:
```
e2NKAXKGX7YFYUHPUuwrcfZ6FUkkYtRUdvzqRUwacPgjMvyYr8mH5Pw4X8Wdt6XgLrK7G7m1TVVeBdVzRDayyHFWp76353A1
```

2) Supply the saved file to the decoder:
```
./petya_key saved_id.txt
```

Choose your version of Petya from the menu. If the given data is valid, you will get your key, i.e:
```
[+] Your key   : TxgTCXnpUPSeR2U7
```

3) **Before unlocking attempt I strongly recommend you to make a dump of the full disk.** Some versions of Petya are buggy. For example they may hang during decryption and corrupt your data.

In order to decrypt MFT, supply the generated key to the bootlocker.<br/>
In order to decrypt **files** you need supply the key to an appropriate decryption tool.
